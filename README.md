# CABLESHIELDTESTINATOR

A post be [AudioPilz](https://www.youtube.com/@AudioPilz) from a while ago challanged me to build a device that non-invasively detects whether a cable is actually shielded or not. 

Cheap audio patch cables today often come unshielded. That means, that the second conductor (ground, the shield) is not actually a mesh of wires wrapped around the signal conductor (as I would expect it from cables for audio. Instead there are just two wires lying next to each other in the coating.

So I was eager to find out whether a cable is shielded or not without cutting it.
